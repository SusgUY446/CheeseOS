# Contributing Guide

Welcome to our project! We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing. Before you get started, please take a moment to review this guide.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository's page.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CheeseOS.git
```

### 3. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive name that summarizes your change:

git checkout -b descriptive-branch-name

Creating a separate branch allows you to isolate your changes from the main branch, making it easier to manage and review your contributions.
### 4. Make Changes

Make your desired changes to the codebase.

### 5. Test Your Changes

Ensure that your changes work as expected. Run any relevant tests and make sure they pass.

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message:
```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

### 7. Push Changes

Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin descriptive-branch-name
```

### 8. Create a Pull Request

Navigate to the original repository and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Provide a descriptive title and summary of your changes in the pull request description. Be sure to mention any related issues or pull requests.

Creating a pull request initiates a discussion around your changes and allows others to review and provide feedback before merging your contribution into the main branch.

Thank you for contributing to CheeseOS!
